# Replit.md

## Overview

This repository appears to be in its initial setup phase, containing only configuration files for Replit's development environment. The current structure includes Semgrep security rules for static code analysis, specifically targeting Bicep (Azure infrastructure-as-code) files. The actual application code and architecture have not yet been established.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The repository is currently minimal and does not contain application code. The existing configuration suggests:

**Static Analysis Setup**
- Semgrep is configured for security scanning
- Current rules focus on Azure Bicep file security (detecting unsecured sensitive parameters)
- The setup indicates potential plans for infrastructure-as-code or cloud deployment components

**Next Steps for Architecture**
When building out this repository, architectural decisions will need to be made regarding:
- Frontend framework selection
- Backend technology stack
- Database and data storage approach
- Authentication mechanisms
- Deployment infrastructure

## External Dependencies

**Development Tools**
- Semgrep: Static analysis tool for security vulnerability detection

**Potential Future Dependencies**
- Azure services (indicated by Bicep rules configuration)
- Additional security scanning tools as the project grows

No application-level external services, APIs, or databases are currently configured.
